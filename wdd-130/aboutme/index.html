    <p> Hi I am Doug. I am taking this class as part of finishing my Interdisplinary degree! 
        Which is a weird thing to talk about, I am just going to tell people I want to do puppet shows.
         I want to make this website cool and friendly, also filled with cat doodles and fun articles. 
         Fun in the way that you need to ask yourself what I am talking about </p>
