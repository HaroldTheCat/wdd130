        [Hello and welcome to Harold the Cat's Animation Studio!This is a site to learn more about the art of animation! You may think you need special programs, time, and dedication to learn the art, and you are correct! The principles of getting started are easy, but mastery is a hard thing! 

        Much like in art, there is a difference between a beginner and a master. Understanding or accomplishing the basics allows you to better appreciate the art form by understanding the principles and difficulty behind the art!
        
        This site has two pages! Wow, isnâ€™t technology great? One page will explain the 12 principles of animation. As well as include examples, while the other page will give you the books and videos that one can use to learn more about and train the subject! 
        
        After all, while there are principles behind every animation that stay the same, much like art, there are many ways to do it.  
        
        This site will primarily cover 2-D animation, as it is the one I am most familiar with. 3-D animation uses many similar principles but require special care and methods for its use. ]

      <h3>[What are the Priciples of Animation?]</h3>
      <p>
        [Squash and Stretch: this mimics illusions due to motions, squash and stretch, show how motions affect the objects, also tells us about what the object is like! Gelatonous or made of stone? This shows it!
        Anticipation: You want your audence to know exaclty what movement your character is going to take, if you dont show this your animation will seam stiff and choppy!
        staging: where are you putting your imaginary cammera? 
        Strait ahead action/ Pose to pose: Two teqniques, why is one principle two? Good Question. Now there is two methods making a scene frame by frame, or building a bunch of poses you want your character to end up in and then making all the inbetween frames.
        Follow Through: Not everthing stops when the action stops, things may keep moving the hair on your head the swish of a jacket this brings reality to your work
        Ease in,Ease out: It is like a car accelerating and decelerating. It doesent just stop and start instantly, it speeds up and slows down, everthing does this, falling objects, runners, every action has a startup and a windown. 
        Arcs: Another principle focusing on realism, how things fall, how things move in relation to each other, how the arm swings, and how somthing falls. Smear frames are a function of this. 
        Secondary Action: It not the primary action! Things like blinking breathing how their arms tense, how their eyes droop, they are doing one thing but you need to add these secondary elements to bring life to your work
        Timing: Timing is important to show that the laws of physics exist in your animation and emphasize the size and weight of charcters. 
        Exaguration: The benefit compaired to real life is that Animation is an expression, and due to many things we animate not being human, you need to make sure no emotions are missunderstood, or more importantly the emotions are registered at all. So many cartoons are exagurated because suble ques are lost in animation. 
        Solid Drawing: Your drawings might be charactertures or somting that can not exist in real life but they have to conform to the rules of the universe you put them in, having weight and established movemnts their shadowns need to react the way people expect. Surprise this comes from practice and instruction!
        Appeal: All your drawings and characters should have Appeal it needs to be somthing that people can look at and feel an emotion. This is the most subjective part of the animation.]

      <h3>[Additional Animation Resources]</h3>
      <p>
        [This stuff is just the basics. So you may ask "How do I learn more about this topic?" The answer is simple! The same place I learned about everything I told you! I recomend these resources! Afterall it is a very open community, with many traditional and modern teqniques! You can use paper and pens, or an Ipad like me! Or you can be the truely brave among us and start doing stop motion animation!
        I would suggest these books!
        I would suggest these videos to learn, and these videos to try to animate youself! And remember that your drawing many pictures, which means you can even use live action footage to make animation]
