<div id="text_1"> <h3>Squash and Stretch</h3> <p>this mimics illusions due to motions, squash and stretch, show how motions affect the objects, also tells us about what the object is like! Gelatonous or made of stone? This shows it! Anticipation: You want your audence to know exaclty what movement your character is going to take, if you dont show this your animation will seam stiff and choppy!</p> </div>
<div id="text_2"> <h3>Anticipation</h3><p>You want your audence to know exaclty what movement your character is going to take, if you dont show this your animation will seam stiff and choppy!</p> </div>
<div id="text_3"> <h3>Strait ahead action/ Pose to pose</h3><p>Two teqniques, why is one principle two? Good Question. Now there is two methods making a scene frame by frame, or building a bunch of poses you want your character to end up in and then making all the inbetween frames</p> </div>
<div id="text_4"> <h3>Follow Through</h3><p>Not everthing stops when the action stops, things may keep moving the hair on your head the swish of a jacket this brings reality to your work </p> </div>
<div id="text_5"> <h3>Ease in,Ease out</h3><p>It is like a car accelerating and decelerating. It doesent just stop and start instantly, it speeds up and slows down, everthing does this, falling objects, runners, every action has a startup and a windown.</p> </div>
<div id="text_6"> <h3>Arcs</h3><p>Another principle focusing on realism, how things fall, how things move in relation to each other, how the arm swings, and how somthing falls. Smear frames are a function of this.</p> </div>
<div id="text_7"> <h3>Secondary Action</h3><p>It not the primary action! Things like blinking breathing how their arms tense, how their eyes droop, they are doing one thing but you need to add these secondary elements to bring life to your work </p> </div>
<div id="text_8"> <h3>Timing</h3><p>Timing is important to show that the laws of physics exist in your animation and emphasize the size and weight of charcters.</p> </div>
<div id="text_9"> <h3>Exaguration</h3><p>The benefit compaired to real life is that Animation is an expression, and due to many things we animate not being human, you need to make sure no emotions are missunderstood, or more importantly the emotions are registered at all. So many cartoons are exagurated because suble ques are lost in animation.</p> </div>
<div id="text_10"> <h3>Solid Drawing</h3><p>Your drawings might be charactertures or somting that can not exist in real life but they have to conform to the rules of the universe you put them in, having weight and established movemnts their shadowns need to react the way people expect. Surprise this comes from practice and instruction!</p> </div>
<div id="text_11"> <h3>Appeal</h3><p> All your drawings and characters should have Appeal it needs to be somthing that people can look at and feel an emotion. This is the most subjective part of the animation.</p> </div>
<div id="text_12"> <h3>Staging</h3> <p>where are you putting your imaginary cammera?</p> </div>
