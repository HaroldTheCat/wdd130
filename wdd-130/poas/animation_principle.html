        <h3>Squash and Stretch</h3>
        <p>
          This mimics illusions due to motions, squash and stretch, show how
          motions affect the objects, also tells us about what the object is
          like! Gelatonous or made of stone? This shows it!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_2">
        <h3>Anticipation</h3>
        <p>
          You want your audence to know exaclty what movement your character is
          going to take, if you dont show this your animation will seam stiff
          and choppy!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_3">
        <h3>Strait ahead action/Pose to pose</h3>
        <p>
          Two teqniques, why is one principle two? Good Question. Now there is
          two methods making a scene frame by frame, or building a bunch of
          poses you want your character to end up in and then making all the
          inbetween frames.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_4">
        <h3>Follow Through</h3>
        <p>
          Not everthing stops when the action stops, things may keep moving the
          hair on your head the swish of a jacket this brings reality to your
          work.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_5">
        <h3>Ease in,Ease out</h3>
        <p>
          It is like a car accelerating and decelerating. It doesent just stop
          and start instantly, it speeds up and slows down, everthing does this,
          falling objects, runners, every action has a startup and a windown.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_6">
        <h3>Arcs</h3>
        <p>
          Another principle focusing on realism, how things fall, how things
          move in relation to each other, how the arm swings, and how somthing
          falls. Smear frames are a function of this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_7">
        <h3>Secondary Action</h3>
        <p>
          It is not the primary action! Things like blinking breathing how their
          arms tense, how their eyes droop, they are doing one thing but you
          need to add these secondary elements to bring life to your work.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_8">
        <h3>Timing</h3>
        <p>
          Timing is important to show that the laws of physics exist in your
          animation and emphasize the size and weight of charcters.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_9">
        <h3>Exaguration</h3>
        <p>
          The benefit compaired to real life is that Animation is an expression,
          and due to many things we animate not being human, you need to make
          sure no emotions are missunderstood, or more importantly the emotions
          are registered at all. So many cartoons are exagurated because subtle
          ques are lost in animation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_10">
        <h3>Solid Drawing</h3>
        <p>
          Your drawings might be charactertures or somting that can not exist in
          real life but they have to conform to the rules of the universe you
          put them in, having weight and established movemnts their shadowns
          need to react the way people expect. Surprise this comes from practice
          and instruction!
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_11">
        <h3>Appeal</h3>
        <p>
          All your drawings and characters should have Appeal it needs to be
          somthing that people can look at and feel an emotion. This is the most
          subjective part of the animation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="text_12">
        <h3>Staging</h3>
        <p>Where are you putting your imaginary cammera?</p>
